# Story Writing Guidelines

## Writing Tasks and Acceptance Criteria for AI Agents

When a story involves applying a new system (like a design system), tasks must be explicit. Do not just say 'Configure the system'; include a specific task like 'Apply the new design system to all visible placeholder element on page X' to ensure the agent's work is visibly verifiable.

This principle is crucial for ensuring clarity and reducing rework, as was highlighted during the retrospective for Story 1.2.
